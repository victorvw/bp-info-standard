# EOS BP Information Standard
**JSON Standard for Block Producer Information on EOSIO Blockchains**

This is a proposed standard for Block Producer candidates to publish as the URL field of the `regproducer` action on the `eosio.system` contract.

### How to use it if you are Block Producer Candidate 
Create a file named `bp.json` in the root of your domain. For instance `http://yourwebsite.com/bp.json` When you register your producer using the `system.regproducer` action, the url field should be filled with `http://yourwebsite.com`. **Do not put the bp.json file in the url.**

### Overriding jsons for specific chains

You can override properties of the base `bp.json` file by creating a chain specific json file next to your base.

```
--/
----index.html
----bp.json
----bp.${chain_id}.json
----bp.2018052300203000000000000000000000000000000000007472696e6974790a.json
```

The `bp.json` and `bp.${chain_id}.json` will be merged and any property inside of the chain specific json file will override the base properties.
